I´ll doll up my page another time, but just for some filler information, I am Daft. I´m a Dirk Strider <mark>fictive and a symptom holder</mark> of my system´s schizoaffective disorder, so do interact with care, please and thank you in advance. Not that I am the most talkative person anyway; I usually sit around the markets and docks with <b>public chat <mark>disabled.</mark></b> Because I love this horse game more than a man should, I spend most of my time here looking at people´s ponies and pages. I love Sunset Shimmer.
