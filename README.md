I´ll doll up my page another time, but just for some filler information, I am Daft, Rook, or Isignia. I´m a <b>splitroject and a <mark>symptom holder</mark></b> of my system´s schizoaffective disorder, so do interact with care, please. Thanks in advance. Not that I am the most talkative person anyway; I usually sit around the markets and docks with <b>public chat disabled.</b> I spend most of my time here looking at people´s ponies and pages. <b>Do not</b> flirt with me or be sexual by any means, I am happily spoken for by <mark>Griefer from Blocktales.</mark> (Har har) My favorite pairings are 1xNoli, Decoydagger (or 7n7time), and Chance1337.
